Subprojecttoctree
*****************
Subprojecttoctrees is a `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ extension that
aims to facilitate the integration of several documentation sources into a single 
`Read the Docs webpage <https://docs.readthedocs.io/>`_. This project extends the 
`Read the Docs subproject <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/subprojects.html>`_
concept, which allows projects to be configured as as as subproject of another project,
by creating a unified sidebar of URLs between these projects. A single 'master' index
is specified in the 'main' project, eliminating the need to update all subprojects to
change the index and allowing for version-specific sidebar links.
